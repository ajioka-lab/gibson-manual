<div class="page-header"><h{{h}}>Gel Purification</h{{h}}></div>
<p>Gel purification is a convenient means of separating the desired products of PCR amplification from off-target amplicons and template DNA. Commercial kits for purification of PCR products from gel matrix are quick and easy to use, e.g. Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.</p>
<p>The below protocol for purification of PCR products is a modified version of the Qiagen protocol employing Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel.</strong> DNA fragment can be excised from the gel with a scalpel or gel excision tips for more standard gel volumes.  Place the excised gel fragment into a colorless tube. If it is not possible to continue immediately with step 2, the excised gel fragment can be stored in the fridge at 4 &deg;C overnight.</li>
	<li><strong>Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel</strong> (100 mg ~ 100 &mu;l). For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes of Buffer QG. The maximum amount of gel slice per QIAquick column is 400 mg.</li>
	<li><strong>Incubate at 50&deg;C for 10 min.</strong> Vortex every 3 minutes for faster dissolving of the gel fragment. Make sure that the gel fragment has dissolved completely. The color of the mixture after the gel fragment has dissolved completely should be yellow similar to the color of the Buffer QG, if the color is orange or violet adjust pH with 10 &mu;l of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0.</li>
	<li><strong>Add 1 volume of isopropanol.</strong> This is important to increase yield of DNA fragments &lt;500 bp and &gt;4 kb.</li>
	<li><strong>Apply the mixture to the QIAquick column placed in a provided 2 ml collection tube and centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 1 min.</strong> The maximum volume for one round of centrifugation is 800 &mu;l. Reuse the same column for higher volumes.</li>
	<li><strong>Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>(Optional) Add 0.5ml of BufferQG toQIAquick column and centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 1 min.</strong> This removes residual agarose, which is important if the DNA will be used for direct sequencing, in vitro transcription, or microinjection.</li>
	<li><strong>Add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 1 min.</strong> (Recommended: let the Qiaquick column stand 2-5 min after addition of Buffer PE).</li>
	<li><strong>Discard flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column at 13000 RPM for an additional 1 min.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>To elute DNA from the QIAquick column, add 50 &mu;l of the Buffer EB or ddH<sub>2</sub>O (pH 7.0-8.5) to the center of the column's membrane and centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 1 min.</strong> For increased DNA concentration, use 30-36 &mu;l of the Buffer EB or ddH<sub>2</sub>O and let the column stand for 1-3 min before centrifugation.</li>
</ol>

	<li>Gel bands can be efficiently excised using gel excision tips, this also results in standard gel volumes.</li>
	<li>Commercial kits for purification of PCR products from gel matrix are quick and easy to use, e.g. Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.</li>
	<li>The quality of purified DNA can be assessed using NanoDrop spectrophotometers. Ethanol precipitation or commercial clean-up kits can be use to further purify DNA.</li>
