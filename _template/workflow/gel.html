<p>Gel purification is a convenient means of separating the desired products of PCR amplification from off-target amplicons and template DNA, the following are general tips for achieving efficient gel extractions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gel bands can be efficiently excised using gel excision tips, this also results in standard gel volumes.</li>
	<li>Commercial kits for purification of PCR products from gel matrix are quick and easy to use, e.g. Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.</li>
	<li>The quality of purified DNA can be assessed using NanoDrop spectrophotometers. Ethanol precipitation or commercial clean-up kits can be use to further purify DNA.</li>
</ul>
