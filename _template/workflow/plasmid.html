<p>Commercial kits for plasmid isolation are quick and easy to use, e.g. Qiagen Qiaprep Spin Mini Kit.</p>
<p>The below protocol for plasmid isolation is a modified version of the Qiagen protocol employing Qiagen Qiaprep Spin Mini Kit.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>(Before start) Prepare Buffers P1 and PE.</strong> Add the provided RNase A solution to Buffer P1 to a final concentration 100 &mu;g/ml, (Optional: Add the provided LyseBlue reagent to Buffer P1 for a final dilution of 1:1000). Store prepared Buffer P1 at 4&deg;C. Add ethanol (96-100%) to Buffer PE. The required volume of ethanol is indicated on the bottle with PE buffer.</li>
	<li><strong>Pick a single colony and inoculate 5 ml LB medium with the appropriate selective antibiotic and incubate overnight on a rotatory shaker.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Pellet bacterial cells by centrifugation.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 &mu;l Buffer P1 in a microcentrifuge
tube.</strong> Make sure bacteria are resuspended completely by pipetting up and
down.</li>
	<li><strong>Add 250 &mu;l Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 10 times.</strong> The bacterial
suspension in the tube should become viscous and slightly clear. (The bacterial suspension in the tube should turn blue if LyseBlue has been added to Buffer P1 in the step 1).</li>
	<li><strong>Add 350 &mu;l Buffer N3 and mix by inverting the tube 10 times.</strong>The bacterial suspension in the tube should become cloudy. (The bacterial suspension in the tube should become colorless if LyseBlue has been added to Buffer P1 in the step 1).</li>
	<li><strong>Centrifuge for 10 min at 13000 rpm.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Transfer the supernatant to the QIAprep spin column by pipetting.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 1 min and discard the flow-through.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>(Recommended) Wash the QIAprep spin column with 0.5 ml Buffer PB.
Centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 1 min and discard the flow-through.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Wash the QIAprep spin column with 0.75ml Buffer PE. Centrifuge at 13000
RPM for 1 min and discard the flow-through.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Remove residual wash buffer by centrifugation at 13000 RPM for 1 min.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Transfer the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Add 50 &mu;l Buffer EB (10 mM Tris&middot;Cl, pH 8.5) or ddH<sub>2</sub>O on the membrane of
the column, let stand for 1 min and centrifuge at 13000 RPM for 1 min.</strong>For increased DNA concentration, use 30-36 &mu;l of the Buffer EB or ddH<sub>2</sub>O and let the column stand for 1-3 min before centrifugation.</li>
</ol>

	<p>Plasmid DNA can be further concentrated by ethanol precipitation</p>
	<ol>
		<li>add 1/10 volume of sodium acetate, pH 5.2 and mix</li>
		<li>add 2.5 volumes of cold 100% ethanol and mix</li>
		<li>incubate at -20&deg;C for 45 min</li>
		<li>centrifuge at 13000RPM for 15 min</li>
		<li>discard supernatant</li>
		<li>add 1ml of 75% ethanol and mix</li>
		<li>centrifuge at 13000RPM for 1 min</li>
		<li>dry and resuspend pellet in the appropriate volume of ddH<sub>2</sub>O or TE buffer</li>
