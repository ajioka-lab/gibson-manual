<p>Several companies provide sequencing services (e.g. Source BioScience). Follow the instructions on the webpage of the particular company for detailed instructions on how to prepare and ship your samples for sequencing. Brief instructions for sequencing services of Source BioScience are as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Register/ create account on the Source BioScience website.</strong> Follow the website of Source BioScience for detailed instructions on how to register.</li>
	<li><strong>Transfer 6 &mu;l of the isolated plasmid DNA to a clean 0.2 ml tube.</strong> For each sequencing reaction/sample prepare 6 &mu;l of the plasmid DNA (e.g. for sequencing of the same DNA with 2 different primers, prepare 12 &mu;l of the plasmid DNA).</li>
	<li><strong>Transfer 10 &mu;l of the 10 &mu;M sequencing primer to a clean 0.2 ml tube.</strong> For each sequencing reaction/sample prepare 10 &mu;l of the sequencing primer (e.g. for sequencing of two plasmids with the same primer prepare 20 &mu;l of the sequencing primer).</li>
	<li><strong>Place the online order for sequencing through the Source BioScience website.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Ship your samples according to instructions on the Source BioScience website.</strong></li>
</ol>

	<ul>
		<li>Some companies such as Source BioScience provide sequencing primers for a
number of standard vectors. Check the website for the selection of available
primers.</li>
		<li>When preparing your own sequencing primer, design the primer 200 bp upstream of the sequence of interest, as the sequencing readout starts 200 bp downstream of the designed primer.</li>
		<li>Write the automatically generated order number displayed at the end of ordering online on the envelope with samples sent for sequencing.</li>
		<li>Sequencing files sent by the company can be compared by a number of
software packages, such as web-based <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/">ClustalW</a></li>
