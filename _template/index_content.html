<p>Gibson Assembly is a high-efficiency method of assembling multiple DNA fargements in a single reaction step [Gibson et al. 2009].</p>
<p>PCR is used to generate DNA fragments with overlapping end sequences (~40bp). After purification (by gel-extraction), these DNA fragments are joined in a single reaction vessel through the activity of three enzymes: T5 exonuclease, DNA polymerase, Taq DNA ligase.</p>
<p>The assembly reaction proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>T5 exonuclease excises nucleotides from the 5’ end of dsDNA molecules, exposing 3’ overhangs.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Benefits</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Any DNA sequences amenable to PCR amplification can be joined, irrespective of the presence of restriction sites.</li>
	<li>Complete control of goal sequence (scarless).</li>
	<li>Up to 20 DNA sequences can be assembled in a single 1 hour reaction.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Disadvantages</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Cost and delivery time of custom primers.</li>
	<li>DNA sequences with high Tm secondary structures or homologous sequences at termini assemble with low efficiency and can result rearrangements.</li>
</ul>
