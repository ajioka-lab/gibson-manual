Gibson Isothermal Assembly is a method of assembling multiple DNA sequences during a 1 hour incubation in a single reaction volume [<a href="http://www.synbio.org.uk/gibson/resources/Gibson2009_nmeth.1318.pdf">Gibson et al. 2009</a>]. 

<h{{h+3}}>Benefits</h{{h+3}}>
<ul>
	<li>No forbidden sequences - DNA sequences can be joined without regard to restriction sites.</li>
	<li>Complete control of product sequence (scarless).</li>
	<li>&gt;10 DNA sequences can be assembled in a single 1 hour reaction.</li>
</ul>

<h{{h+3}}>Disadvantages</h{{h+3}}>
<ul>
	<li>Cost and delivery time of custom primers.</li>
	<li>Rearrangements are possible where there are regions of homology close to the termini of substrate sequences, which can compete with intended assembly reactions.</li>
	<li>Substrate DNA sequences with high Tm secondary structures may assemble with low efficiency.</li>
</ul>


<h{{h+2}}>The scope of this manual</h{{h+2}}>

This manual is intended primarily for users with graduate-level knowledge of molecular biology. It introduces users to the principles of Gibson Isothermal Assembly and its application, as well as providing guidance on implementing an efficient workflow and on troubleshooting. The focus is on primer design and the assembly reaction, but also includes descriptions of other steps in a typical Gibson Isothermal Assembly in order to giving the reader an overview of a complete workflow.


<h{{h+1}}>The Gibson Assembly Reaction</h{{h+1}}>
<p>Terminal regions of ~40 bp homologous sequence determine the order in which substrate sequences are assembled. Substrate DNA sequences are added to a reaction volume containing the enzymes i) T5 exonuclease, ii) Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase&reg; and iii) Taq DNA ligase. The reaction is incubated for 1 hour at 50&deg;C.</p>

<ol class="summary_list">
	<li>T5 exonuclease excises nucleotides from the 5&prime; end of dsDNA molecules, exposing 3&prime; overhangs. (Similar reactions will occur at all DNA termini, but for the sake of simplicity we show one assembly junction only).

	<li>Complementary  3&prime; overhangs anneal.
	<img src="./img/summary_2.png" alt="Complementary  3&prime; overhangs anneal."></li>
	<li>T5 exonuclease (unstable at 50&deg;C) denatures, exposing free 3&prime; overhangs  to Phusion DNA polymerase.
	<img src="./img/summary_3.png" alt="T5 exonuclease denatures."></li>
	<li>Phusion DNA polymerase fills the 3&prime; overhang.
	<img src="./img/summary_4.png" alt="Phusion DNA polymerase fills the 3&prime; overhang."></li>
 	<li>The DNA polymerase releases the DNA once the overhangs are filled, allowing Taq DNA ligase to seals nicks in the phosphodiester backbone (i.e. catalyse the formation of phosphodiester bonds between 5&prime; phosphate and 3&prime; hydroxyl groups).

</ol>

<p>More than 10 sequences can be assembled in a single reaction, resulting in linear or circular DNA as desired.</p>

<p>Substrate DNA sequences can be produced easily by PCR.  The assembly reaction can be used directly to transform E. coli cells, without prior purification. DNA assembly using Gibson Isothermal Assembly is therefore flexible, quick and inexpensive.</p>
